# Film Query Project

## Description

This project integrates java with mysql to allow a user to search a database of films and actors. At the start of the program, the user is presented with a menu. The user follows the prompts to search for a film either by a valid film id or by a keyword. If no film is found for the film id or the keyword, a message is displayed saying so and is given an opportunity to search again from the initial menu options. If a film is found, the film title, year, rating, description, language, and list of actors in its cast is displayed. The user can exit the program using an option from the main menu.

## Lessons Learned 

In this project, I learned how to make basic mysql queries and how to adjust them for use in a Java program. I learned a little about how to use prepared statements in this type of program. I also gained a little better understanding of basic Java principles that I haven't understood very well in the past. I still have much to learn, but I can see improvement in my understanding and in my code as I am continuing to study and practice programming.
